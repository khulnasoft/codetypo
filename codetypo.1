.SH NAME
codetypo \- detect spelling mistakes in source code
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcodetypo\fR [OPTIONS] [file1 file2 ... fileN]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
codetypo is designed to find and fix common misspellings in text files.
It is designed primarily for checking misspelled words in source code,
but it can be used with other files as well.

.SS "positional arguments:"
.TP
files
files or directories to check
.SS "options:"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
show this help message and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show program's version number and exit
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-disable\-colors\fR
disable colors, even when printing to terminal
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-enable\-colors\fR
enable colors, even when not printing to terminal
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-write\-changes\fR
write changes in place if possible
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-dictionary\fR DICTIONARY
comma\-separated list of custom dictionary files that
contain spelling corrections. If this flag is not
specified or equals "\-" then the default dictionary is
used.
.TP
\fB\-\-builtin\fR BUILTIN\-LIST
comma\-separated list of builtin dictionaries to
include (when "\-D \-" or no "\-D" is passed). Current
options are:
\- 'clear' for unambiguous errors
\- 'rare' for rare (but valid) words that are likely to
.TP
be errors
\- 'informal' for making informal words more formal
\- 'usage' for replacing phrasing with recommended
.TP
terms
\- 'code' for words from code and/or mathematics that
.TP
are likely to be typos in other contexts (such as
uint)
.TP
\- 'names' for valid proper names that might be typos
\- 'en_to_en\-OX' for corrections from en to en\-OX
The default is 'clear,rare'.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-regex\fR IGNORE_REGEX
regular expression that is used to find patterns to
ignore by treating as whitespace. When writing regular
expressions, consider ensuring there are boundary nonword chars, e.g., "\ebmatch\eb". Defaults to
empty/disabled.
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-multiline\-regex\fR IGNORE_MULTILINE_REGEX
regular expression that is used to ignore text that
may span multi\-line regions. The regex is run with
re.DOTALL. For example to allow skipping of regions of
Python code using begin/end comments one could use:
\fB\-\-ignore\-multiline\-regex\fR '# codetypo:ignore\-begin
*\en.*# codetypo:ignore\-end *\en'. Defaults to
empty/disabled.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-words\fR FILES
comma\-separated list of files that contain words to be
ignored by codetypo. Files must contain 1 word per
line. Words are case sensitive based on how they are
written in the dictionary file.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-words\-list\fR WORDS
comma\-separated list of words to be ignored by
codetypo. Words are case sensitive based on how they
are written in the dictionary file.
.TP
\fB\-\-uri\-ignore\-words\-list\fR WORDS
comma\-separated list of words to be ignored by
codetypo in URIs and emails only. Words are case
sensitive based on how they are written in the
dictionary file. If set to "*", all misspelling in
URIs and emails will be ignored.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-regex\fR REGEX
regular expression that is used to find words. By
default any alphanumeric character, the underscore,
the hyphen, and the apostrophe are used to build
words. This option cannot be specified together with
\fB\-\-write\-changes\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-uri\-regex\fR URI_REGEX
regular expression that is used to find URIs and
emails. A default expression is provided.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-summary\fR
print summary of fixes
.TP
\fB\-\-count\fR
print the number of errors as the last line of stderr
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-skip\fR SKIP
comma\-separated list of files to skip. It accepts
globs as well. E.g.: if you want codetypo to skip .eps
and .txt files, you'd give "*.eps,*.txt" to this
option.
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exclude\-file\fR FILES
ignore whole lines that match those in the commaseparated list of files EXCLUDE. The lines in these
files should match the to\-be\-excluded lines exactly
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-interactive\fR MODE
set interactive mode when writing changes:
\- 0: no interactivity.
\- 1: ask for confirmation.
\- 2: ask user to choose one fix when more than one is
.TP
available.
\- 3: both 1 and 2
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\-level\fR LEVEL
bitmask that allows suppressing messages:
\- 0: print all messages.
\- 1: disable warnings about wrong encoding.
\- 2: disable warnings about binary files.
\- 4: omit warnings about automatic fixes that were
.TP
disabled in the dictionary.
\- 8: don't print anything for non\-automatic fixes.
\- 16: don't print the list of fixed files.
\- 32: don't print configuration files.
As usual with bitmasks, these levels can be combined;
e.g. use 3 for levels 1+2, 7 for 1+2+4, 23 for
1+2+4+16, etc. The default mask is 34.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-hard\-encoding\-detection\fR
use chardet to detect the encoding of each file. This
can slow down codetypo, but is more reliable in
detecting encodings other than utf\-8, iso8859\-1, and
ascii.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-check\-filenames\fR
check file names as well
.TP
\fB\-H\fR, \fB\-\-check\-hidden\fR
check hidden files and directories (those starting
with ".") as well.
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-after\-context\fR LINES
print LINES of trailing context
.TP
\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-\-before\-context\fR LINES
print LINES of leading context
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-context\fR LINES
print LINES of surrounding context
.TP
\fB\-\-stdin\-single\-line\fR
output just a single line for each misspelling in
stdin mode
.TP
\fB\-\-config\fR CONFIG
path to config file.
.TP
\fB\-\-toml\fR TOML
path to a pyproject.toml file.
